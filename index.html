        <h2>Welcome!</h2>
        <p>
          Welcome to my web page! If you're here, I'm guessing you are
          either a potential employer, a friend, or a stranger who's stumbled
          upon this page by accident. But I guess that's not too relevant: Whichever
          category you belong to, I'm hoping it'll be interesting
          enough to keep you around!

        <h2>What is this website?</h2>
        <p>
          In short, I'm not really sure. I became interested in
          web design, and then, a few
          <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/" target="_blank">w3schools</a>
          tutorials later, I wanted to make a website.
          If I <i>had</i> to describe its origins, I would characterize this
          website as a result of two impulses of mine: an impulse to
          create and an impulse to share.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm hoping that this site will act as a creative outlet for me. It
          has already served as an opportunity to learn HTML, CSS, and
          JavaScript&mdash;and at the same time, to showcase those skills
          in a creative, tasteful, and fun way. I'll also be able to use it
          to render some of the other projects that I've completed (or intend to
          complete) visible&mdash;those usually more mathematics-based.
          That is, I see this site as an opportunity to bring to life
          some of the mathematical and physical processes that I find most
          interesting, to create a display for them that matches
          their beautiful innerworkings.
        </p>
        <p>
          Creating seems to be intrinsically linked to community, and I am not
          above that rule. I want to
          use this website as a platform for sharing what I find
          interesting, beautiful, and fun. There are certainly other platforms
          in social media that are better suited to the sharing aspect, and
          I'm sure there are other people who have completed (likely with higher
          quality than mine) similar, if not identical, projects, but
          building these projects myself and sharing them through a medium
          that I've created feels more personal and communal. Doing so allows me
          to customize things so as to underscore what is most important to me.
        </p>
        <p>
          Of course, not everything is so serious.
          I've also included some mini-games and math-memes just because they
          are fun. It's because of this eclectic gathering of jokes, games,
          mathematics, and other miscellaneous categories that
          just happen to draw my wandering attention long enough to earn a
          tab on this page that I have to say, in the end, I'm not really sure
          what this website is. But I've built it nonetheless, so here it is,
          and I hope you enjoy it as much as I do!

        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          I'm currently an undergrad student in math and physics, and I have worked
          as a tutor and teaching assistant in mathematics and as a data science
          intern in retail pricing optimization. Although I am not pursuing a
          degree in the humanities, I've also enjoyed some coursework in English
          and history.
        </p>
        <p>
          Less formally, I've been studying computer science and Spanish. By
          <q>studying,</q> I mean that I've been completing
          <a href=https://leetcode.com/>LeetCode's</a> monthly challenges and
          like to read <a href=https://www.duolingo.com/>Duolingo's</a>
          stories in Spanish. I'm not an expert in either field, but I like to
          think myself competent. I've done enough learning to be familiar with
          algorithmic thinking and basic data structures, and I think that my
          Spanish has reached the point where I can ask people to slow down
          so that I can figure out what they are saying based on their hand
          motions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some of my other interests include reading (mostly fiction), chess,
          and sports.

        <h2>Some Acknowledgements</h2>
        <p>
          I've used the following sources extensively for personal learning,
          and I am very grateful for their help.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><a href=https://leetcode.com/>LeetCode:</a> introduction to
            algorithms and datastructures; practice solving programming problems
            in Python, C++, and JavaScript.</li>
          <li><a href=https://w3schools.com/>w3schools:</a> introduction to
            HTML, CSS, and Javascript; extremely helpful in getting to the
            point where I could build this website.</li>
          <li><a href=https://duolingo.com/>Duolingo:</a> learning Spanish. It
            is an extremely different category from the previous resources,
            but I've benefited from their platform extensively and am very
            grateful for the free learning they provide!</li>

        <p>Hopefully I can put
        something useful in this sidebar.
        Until then, you'll have to enjoy this fun animation of a bunny
        that I made. Mouse over it and see what happens!
